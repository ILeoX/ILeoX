- 👋 Hi, I’m @ILeoX
- 👀 I’m interested in sliding my way into world domination (watch your back. Yer flanks too O mortal). I have a good background in javascript, python, and can manage a few Java madness.
- 🌱 Currently, my only interest is in dominitaing the blockchain universe. When that is achieved, I will change this README.md to inform you about something else I'm going to domniate. Think of me as a villain.
- 💞️ If you've got the courage, I don't mind collaborating on interesting projects involving the blockchain.
- 📫 How to reach me [discord @ILeoX]
